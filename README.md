## Desicions 

I decided to use @vueuse/core library because it provides a lot of useful composables that will simplify the code and make it more readable. I could create those myself but it would be pointless because the final code will be the same and the library is three-shakeable so the bundle size would be very small. The library is also well tested by millions of users and that ensures that it won't be broken.
